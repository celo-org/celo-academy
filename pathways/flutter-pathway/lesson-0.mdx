## Introduction

In this tutorial, we're going to build a deployable smart contract and an accompanying Flutter widget to add comment threads to your apps.

### How the DAPP works

Here's what we're aiming to build.

By adding comment threads such as this around our app we can let our users have conversations anywhere about anything!

## Prerequisites

First, This tutorial assumes that you are already familiar with solidity and understand how smart contracts work and also assumes that you already know the basics of using Flutter or you can please clone the [flutter web3 celo](https://github.com/Mujhtech/flutter-web3-celo). You'll also want to make sure you've installed the MetaMask Mobile App and have a MetaMask account. If you'd like, see our prior tutorial Setting Up Your Wallet for more details on this.

For this project we'll be using a few interesting dependencies & dev dependencies:

- [walletconnect_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/walletconnect_dart/example)
- [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider/example)
- [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http/example)
- [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher/example)
- [jazzicon](https://pub.dev/packages/jazzicon/example)
- [web3dart](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart/example)

For dev dependencies:

- [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner)
- [web3dart_builders](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart_builders)

We'll walk you through each one as we go and show you how to use them in combination to write some awesome dapps.
