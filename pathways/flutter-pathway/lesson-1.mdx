## Getting Started

In this lesson, we will learn how to install Celo Composer and use it to generate a Flutter project that integrates with the Celo blockchain. Celo Composer is a command-line tool that provides a framework for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Celo blockchain. It offers a streamlined development experience that includes web3 and walletconnect integration, enabling you to connect your dApp to the blockchain and create secure and fast crypto payments.


### Using Celo Composer

We will use Celo Composer to generate a new Flutter project that integrates with blockchain. To create a new project, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx @celo/celo-composer create
```

Celo Composer will prompt you to choose a framework from the available options. Choose "Flutter" and follow the on-screen prompts to create a new Flutter project that integrates with the Celo blockchain.

Example output - 

```text

Celo Composer CLI
? Choose front-end framework: Flutter
? Choose smart-contract framework: None
? Create a subgraph: No
? Project name:  flutter-demo
```

To learn more about Celo Composer follow the documentation - [https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/) and Flutter documentation - [https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/packages/flutter-app/README.md](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/packages/flutter-app/README.md)

Once the project is created, you'll have a new directory with your project name and a Flutter project structure within it.

The generated Flutter project structure will look like this:

```text
├──pacakges
  └──flutter-app
      └──.vscode
      └──android
      └──ios
      └──lib
      └──.gitignore
      └──pubspec.yaml
```

Let's take a closer look at each of these folders:

- android: This folder contains all the Android-specific code.
- ios: This folder contains all the IOS-specific code.
- lib: This folder contains core modules, controllers, UI code, constants, and more.
- .gitignore: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
- pubspec.yaml: This file is generated when you create a new Flutter project and contains dependencies and other project metadata.

That's it! You now have a new Flutter project that integrates with the Celo blockchain. In the next lesson, we will explore the different packages that we will be using in our project.
